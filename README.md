# Show your support!

Development of this extension was fully self-funded by Cividesk and equated to about 40 hours of work.

You can show your support and appreciation for our work by making a donation at https://www.cividesk.com/pay and indicating 'SparkPost support' as the invoice id.

Suggested donation amounts are _$40 for end-users_, and _$40 per client_ using this extension for service providers. With these suggested amounts, we would need 120 donations just to recoup our development costs. Needless to say we are far from that at the moment!

These donations will fund maintenance and updates for this extension, as well as production of other extensions in the future.

Thanks!
